### Capstone Project Proposal

In our globalised world it is quite common people moving around to take good opportunities, what could be a better position in their companies, a new job offer, a chance to learn from different cultures or even improvements in their quality of life.

People who has already been in the situation of relocating to an unknown place, perhaps abroad, may have experienced the confusion and doubts to choose a place to live like, it it better near to work place or school? Near city downtown or periphery? Decisions like this normally are also not comming alone, there are lots of stressing tasks to perform, all together.

My proposal for this project is to provide support to relocators, or relocation service providers, with the task of choosing a place to live. Using the relocator profile and a target geographic location, a rank of different places will be provided to the relocator, giving some directions to support during the evaluation process of choosing a place to live.
